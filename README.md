# Development

* `atlas-run`   -- installs this plugin into Bamboo and starts it on http://localhost:6990/bamboo
* `atlas-debug` -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* `atlas-cli`   -- after atlas-run or atlas-debug, opens a Maven command line window:
                 - 'pi' reinstalls the plugin into the running Bamboo instance
* `atlas-help`  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK
